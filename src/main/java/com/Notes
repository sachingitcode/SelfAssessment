analyze criterias for algorithm optimisation

1. time
2. Space
3. database connectivity
4. data transfer (network bandwith)  :like using algo to concvert image into suc a bit form that it transfers easily on lower bandwith
5. power consumption
6. Cpu Registers


use of factory method with overriding is present in apiservice3 for user/users with userVars


Example Problem Solving Workflow
Read the problem statement carefully.
Identify the type of problem (e.g., searching, sorting, dynamic programming, etc.).
Choose the appropriate data structure.
Select the algorithmic approach.
Write pseudocode to outline your solution.
Implement the solution in code.
Test your solution with various test cases.
Analyze the complexity of your solution.
Optimize if necessary.
